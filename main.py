"""
Finding common English words is this program main purpose.
This script will iterate through the user-supplied document (in .txt format only)
and will show 50 most common words sorted by decreasing frequency.

Program's Graphical User Interface (GUI) is made in the Tkinter library
as it is sufficiently robust and widely supported in Python.

Even though this script is heavily modified (GUI, different sorting algorithm,
new validation method) this work is based on the project from Open University (see [CREDITS] section).

Credits:
This code was initially my Open University Project and I had to do most of this myself,
but I need to mention that the whole idea of this app is thanks to Open University team
behind M269-18J module (Algorithms, data structures and computability),
which I wholeheartedly recommend to study.
